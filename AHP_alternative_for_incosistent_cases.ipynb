        "The aggregated preference matrix is a composite matrix derived from multiple pairwise comparison matrices (PCMs) and a vector of weights that signify the relative importance of each PCM. Each reciprocal PCM $R^{(i)}$ is weighted by $w_i$​ from the weight vector $w$. The aggregated preference matrix is computed using the element-wise geometric mean of the weighted PCMs, ensuring that the results remains reciprocal. This process is crucial for combining evaluations across different criteria or experts into a single, coherent PCM for decision-making. For a precise definition, see equation (3) in refered paper."

Key criteria for tool selection include *quality assurance, cost efficiency, delivery reliability, supplier reputation, and environmental impact*. Eight pre-screened tools are evaluated against these criteria. A decision-making group of three stakeholders (*supply chain analyst, market trend analyst, and sustainability auditor*) provides input, with their evaluations aggregated using AHP to ensure systematic, data-driven decision-making.
