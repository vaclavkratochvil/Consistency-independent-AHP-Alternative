        "The aggregated preference matrix is a composite matrix derived from multiple pairwise comparison matrices (PCMs) and a vector of weights that signify the relative importance of each PCM. Each reciprocal PCM $R^{(i)}$ is weighted by $w_i$​ from the weight vector $w$. The aggregated preference matrix is computed using the element-wise geometric mean of the weighted PCMs, ensuring that the results remains reciprocal. This process is crucial for combining evaluations across different criteria or experts into a single, coherent PCM for decision-making. For a precise definition, see equation (3) in refered paper."

By taking the element-wise logarithm of the PCM, a skew-symmetric matrix is obtained. This matrix allows the formulation of a system of linear inequalities that identifies all maximal preferred elements based on the Subjective Stochastic Dominance (SSB) representation. To address any potential non-uniqueness among these elements, the optimal distribution of preference is defined as the unique maximal preferred element that maximizes entropy. This optimal distribution represents the most balanced and unbiased allocation of preferences.\n",

For a consistent PCM, the canonical weight vector aligns with the weight vector used in the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). This approach ensures that the derived weight vector accurately represents the underlying preferences and priorities, even in the presence of inconsistencies within the PCM.\n",

        "A textile manufacturing company in Italy seeks to optimize its supplier selection process using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) methodology to choose the best data analytics tool. The company's operations *span product development, manufacturing, sales, marketing, and overall management*. Key criteria for tool selection include *quality assurance, cost efficiency, delivery reliability, supplier reputation, and environmental impact*. Eight pre-screened tools are evaluated against these criteria. A decision-making group of three stakeholders (*supply chain analyst, market trend analyst, and sustainability auditor*) provides input, with their evaluations aggregated using AHP to ensure systematic, data-driven decision-making. Implementing the chosen tool involves significant costs in acquisition, infrastructure, training, and integration.\n",
